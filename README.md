# CARIS

### 604's Auto-Responding Discord Chat Bot

#### Developed by [QuiPS](https://quips.info)

Uses framework: https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J

## How to run CARIS:

### Quick Method

If on a \*nix system, it is likely that the run.sh script will suit your needs.
To use it, pass the the desired token as the first parameter.
```
./run.sh TOKEN
```
Alternatively, it is possible to store the token inside of the script itself, at the line: `declare TOKEN=""`
This is not reccomended, as it can lead to the easy mistake of committing the token value by accident.

### Using Gradle

A version of Gradle has been included in the CARIS repository.
It can be run with `./gradlew`, or `./gradlew.bat`, depending on whether the system is \*nix based or Windows based.

It is also possible to use a system install of gradle, if desired.
Both methods of running Gradle are equivalent.
